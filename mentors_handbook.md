# Mentors Handbook

## Code of Conduct

As a participating Mentor in the Junior Developers Singapore Mentoring Program (JDSG Mentoring Program), I agree to abide by the JDSG Mentoring Program Code of Conduct for Mentors. I agree that if I violate any rule of the Code of Conduct for Mentors, JuniorDevSG may suspend or terminate my participation as a Mentor in the JDSG Mentoring Program.

1. **Confidentiality**

	Except as provided below, I shall not disclose to any third party any personal details of my communications with my Mentee without prior permission of my Mentee. Exceptions: Code Violations. If my Mentee violates the JDSG Mentoring Program Code of Conduct for Mentees, I shall report the code violations to JDSG Mentoring Program staff at juniordevsg-mentoring@codersg.com
 
2. **Availability**

	I shall be available for the group mentoring sessions with my Mentees. In between the group mentoring sessions, I shall spend a minimum of 15 minutes a week to communicate with my Mentee Buddy.

	> *Note:* If the Mentor will be temporarily unavailable for a short period (for example, the Mentor leaves on a week-long business trip), the Mentor should inform your mentoring group in advance. In specific instances, the Mentee may require substantially more time from the Mentor. If the Mentor cannot commit sufficient time to fulfill the Mentee’s needs, the Mentor should notify JDSG Mentoring Program so that JDSG can try to match the Mentee with another Mentor.
 
3. **Communications**

	In my communications with my Mentees, (1) I shall not use offensive language, and (2) I shall not transmit offensive images. Offensive language includes, but is not limited to, (a) profanity or verbal abuse directed towards the Mentee, (b) sexually suggestive comments directed towards the Mentee, and (c) derogatory remarks directed towards any individual or group of individuals based on religion, race, color, ethnicity, country of origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, or sexual identity. Offensive images include, but are not limited to, (a) images that are sexually suggestive, lewd, or pornographic and (b) images that include offensive language, as described above.
	
	> *Note:* "Communications" refers to communications via any media; for example, in-person, phone, mail, photographs, voice-mail, audio conferencing, video conferencing, audio recordings, video recordings, e-mail, electronic text messaging, computer files supplied on physical media, and computer files transferred electronically.
 
4. **Topics for Discussion**

	If my Mentees expresses unwillingness, reluctance, or discomfort in discussing any topic that I have raised, I shall promptly cease pursuing that topic.
	
	> *Notes:* The specific personal issues and the degree of personal detail that are appropriate for discussion will depend strongly on the specific Mentor, the specific Mentee, and the specific circumstances. Therefore, JDSG Mentoring Program does not provide a comprehensive list of appropriate and inappropriate topics and does not provide guidance on the degree of personal detail to be shared: The Mentor and the Mentee should agree on the topics that they are comfortable discussing and on the degree of personal details that they are comfortable sharing. The Mentor, for example, may appropriately initiate discussion of personal topics such as problems with family and friends, religion, and death. The Mentor should, however, approach such topics cautiously and ask the Mentee whether the Mentee wishes to pursue such topics. If the Mentee expresses unwillingness, reluctance, or discomfort in discussing a specific topic, the Mentor shall promptly cease pursuing that specific topic.
 
5. **Personal Relationships**

	I shall not pursue a romantic or sexual relationship with my Mentees.
 
6. **Meetings in Person**

	If my Mentees does not wish to meet in person, I shall not insist on a meeting.

	> *Note:* If circumstances permit, in-person meetings between the Mentor and the Mentee can be beneficial for developing personal rapport, and the Mentee can often benefit from visiting the Mentor’s workplace. It is appropriate for the Mentor to invite the Mentee to meet in person; but, if the Mentee does not wish to meet in person, then the Mentor shall not insist on a meeting.
 
7. **Prohibited Advice**

	I shall not provide medical, mental-health, or legal advice to my Mentees.

	> *Note:* Medical, mental-health, or legal advice should be provided by a qualified professional. Even if the Mentor is coincidentally a qualified professional (for example, if the Mentor is a physician, psychologist, or attorney), the Mentor shall not provide medical, mental-health, or legal advice to the Mentee: Within the JDSG Mentoring Program Program, the Mentor provides guidance for the academic and professional development of the Mentee. The Mentor should advise the Mentee to seek the assistance of another qualified professional.
 
8. **Knowledgeable Advice**

	I shall provide advice only on topics in which I have knowledge.

	> *Note:* Mentors shall refrain from providing advice on topics in which they have little or no knowledge. Incorrect advice can have detrimental consequences. For example, a CV for a Mentee seeking an academic position is different from a resume for a Mentee seeking an industrial position. Thus, a Mentor who has experience only with CVs for academic positions should not advise a Mentee on writing a resume for an industrial position. Instead, the Mentor should seek the assistance of a colleague who does have experience with resumes for industrial positions (before contacting a colleague for assistance, the Mentor should first receive permission from the Mentee). If the Mentor does not have an appropriate colleague, then the Mentor should inform the Mentee that the Mentee needs to seek advice from someone knowledgeable.
 
9. **Fees**

	I shall not charge my Mentees any fees during the period of our mentorship.

	> *Note:* The Mentor is a volunteer and shall not charge a fee for serving as a mentor. Even if the Mentor is employed such that the Mentor normally charges fees for services related to mentorship (for example, if the Mentor is a professional career coach who normally charges fees for preparing resumes), the Mentor shall not charge the Mentee any fees during the period of mentorship.
 
10. **Business Relationships**

	I shall not pursue a business relationship with my Mentee in which my Mentees derives no benefit from the business relationship.

	> *Note:* An internship, paid or unpaid, can provide valuable experience for the Mentee. If the internship is paid, then the Mentee obviously derives a financial benefit. If the internship is unpaid, then the internship is appropriate only if the Mentee acquires valuable experience or new skills; for example, if the Mentor is providing guidance, training, and review. If the internship is unpaid, then the internship is not appropriate if the Mentee is only performing a service for the Mentor or other party (such as a sponsor). For example, if the Mentee is a skilled programmer and the Mentor requires the services of a skilled programmer, the Mentor shall not request the Mentee to provide programming services without compensation.
 
11. **Duty to Report Code Violations**

	If I observe any Participant behaving in a manner that violates the JDSG Mentoring Program Code of Conduct for Mentors or the JDSG Mentoring Program Code of Conduct for Mentees, I shall promptly report my observations to JDSG Mentoring Program staff at juniordevsg-mentoring@codersg.com.
