# Pilot Batch (11 Apr - 21 May)

## Background:

We did a survey with the JuniorDevSG group and identified three areas that they needed mentoring guidance:

- Career coaching and guidance
- Professional growth
- Work related / technical skills

We hope to address the first with career coaching talks at meetups. For technical skills, we will have Developer’s Gym workshops with specific skills training.

As for the area of professional growth, we feel it might be best addressed with regular mentoring sessions where junior devs can gain insights for their personal and professional growth.

For the pilot program, the format will be casual group chat between mentees and mentors. There will be regular follow up on their progress and field any questions they may have about the career in general or anything technical to mentors.

We feel that doing this with a consistent group and on a regular cadence would provide a safe zone for more meaningful & deeper sharing, and for the group to help each other in a sustainable manner. Our hope is that they will form some sort of accountability circle in the groups.

We are thinking of a fortnightly arrangement with small groups of 4 (1:3 ratio mentor to mentees). Weekday evenings was also preferred by the mentees.

We plan to hold it at a fixed location for the first few sessions. Tuesday evenings. First session on 11 April as a kick off for all the people to do self-intro. At the end of the evening the mentees will put up 2 names for preferred mentors and then we'll group them up before the next session.

If there are topics that we feel might be best covered as a training session, we will escalate it to the Developer's Gym or meetup talks.
