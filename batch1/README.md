**CTO, Straits Interactive**

I’m currently the CTO of Straits Interactive and I build enterprise software tools that help companies manage their privacy compliance efforts across the region.
Some of the companies currently include Samsung, Changi Airport, IKEA, Loreal and the Data Protection Commission of Ghana.
In my current stint I've successfully deployed projects that involve a wide range of technologies including blockchain, VR, HTML5 games, ML and chatbots.

Personally, I’ve been doing tech for about 6 years since graduating from NUS with a degree in Chemistry.
Learnt all that I know by starting from simple HTML websites and progressing through Wordpress & Drupal to finally settling on Python / Django.
Founded 2 startups and helped many more build their MVPs through doing side projects.
Had my first mini exit when a startup I worked with was acquired by a Japanese company.

I bring to the table a wealth of experience developing enterprise solutions across different industries.
Having dabbled in different tech, I can advise too on what are the current hypes and how to properly leverage them to build solutions that can be commercialised.

### Brecht Missotten

**Senior Frontend Developer, Red Airship**

Brecht Missotten is a senior front-end developer currently working at Red Airship. His story starts more than 15 years ago when he got his first access to the world wide web. Initially, he taught himself to create 3D graphics and animation but soon wanted to share his trial and error with the world. It wasn't long until he realised that frontpage doesn't cut it and that's where his career as a developer started. He tried a few different programming languages but in recent years he prefers to focus on the front-end. Before moving to work and live in Singapore he was teaching and guiding students in Belgium.

His mentoring can be technical related, but he prefers to put the focus on soft skills and guidance.

### Tai Shi Ling

![Tai Shi Ling](./images/mentor_shiling_tai.jpg)

**CEO, UI-licious**

I'm Shi Ling, currently the CEO and co-founder of UI-licious, a startup that builds developer tools to test user interfaces for web applications. I graduated from Singapore Management University with a degree in Information Systems. While most of my university peers chose a job in large corporations, I decided to work in a startup in my first job as a full-stack web developer in order to not be limited by any specialisation - I moved from working on analytics, to back-end development, system administration, and front-end development. For me, I found my sweet spot in front-end development, because the reason why I chose to be an engineer, which is to build things for people. Working in front-end brings me closest to the users, at a startup, you need to wear many hats, including customer support and product design. I've also always enjoyed teaching, and had been a teaching assistant through my four years in university for engineering courses. Though these days I spend most of my time working on documenting design and technical specs to educate and communicate ideas to junior developers in my team. AMA about software engineering, quality management, design, and communication.

### William Haw

![William Haw](./images/mentor_william_haw.jpg)

**Software Engineer, Agoda**

Hi, I'm William. I've been working as a software engineer for nearly 4 years now, first in a tiny 4 man startup and now in a large tech company.

My core skill is the design and architecture of distributed systems, mainly within the Java ecosystem. I've also been programming in Scala at work for a year now.

I also have a good understanding of what it takes to deploy my apps into production and other DevOps best practices like building CI/CD pipelines.

Other than these, please feel free to ask me anything about object oriented programming, design patterns, databases, message queues, cloud computing and, dare I say, soft skills.

P.S. A pretty detailed list of what I know (and don't know) can be found here: <https://williamhaw.com/everything-i-know-about-development-2019/>
