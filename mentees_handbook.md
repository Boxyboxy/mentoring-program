# Mentees Handbook

## Code of Conduct

As a participating Mentee in the Junior Developers Singapore Mentoring Program (JDSG Mentoring Program), I agree to abide by the JDSG Mentoring Program Code of Conduct for Mentees. I agree that if I violate of any rule of the JDSG Mentoring Program Code of Conduct for Mentees, JDSG Mentoring Program may suspend or terminate my participation as a Mentee in the JDSG Mentoring Program Program.
 
1. **Confidentiality**

	Except as provided below, I shall not disclose to any third party any personal details of my communications with my Mentor without prior permission of my Mentor. Exception: Code Violations. If my Mentor violates the JDSG Mentoring Program Code of Conduct for Mentors, I shall report the code violations to JDSG Mentoring Program staff at juniordevsg-mentoring@codersg.com
 
2. **Availability**

	I shall be available for the group mentoring sessions with my Mentees. In between the group mentoring sessions, I shall spend a minimum of 15 minutes a week to communicate with my Mentor Buddy.
	
	> *Note:* If the Mentee will be temporarily unavailable for a short period (for example, to study for exams), the Mentee should notify the Mentor in advance. The Mentor is reserving time to participate in a mentorship: The Mentor’s time is wasted if the Mentee does not also reserve time to participate in the mentorship.
 
3. **Communications**

	In my communications with my Mentor, (1) I shall not use offensive language, and (2) I shall not transmit offensive images. Offensive language includes, but is not limited to, (a) profanity or verbal abuse directed towards the Mentor, (b) sexually suggestive comments directed towards the Mentor, and (c) derogatory remarks directed towards any individual or group of individuals based on religion, race, color, ethnicity, country of origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, or sexual identity. Offensive images include, but are not limited to, (a) images that are sexually suggestive, lewd, or pornographic and (b) images that include offensive language, as described above.
	
	> *Notes:* "Communications" refers to communications via any media; for example, in-person, phone, mail, photographs, voice-mail, audio conferencing, video conferencing, audio recordings, video recordings, e-mail, electronic text messaging, computer files supplied on physical media, and computer files transferred electronically.
	

4. **Topics for Discussion**

	If my Mentor expresses unwillingness, reluctance, or discomfort in discussing any topic that I have raised, I shall promptly cease pursuing that topic.

	> *Notes:* The specific personal issues and the degree of personal detail that are appropriate for discussion will depend strongly on the specific Mentor, the specific Mentee, and the specific circumstances. Therefore, JDSG Mentoring Program does not provide a comprehensive list of appropriate and inappropriate topics and does not provide guidance on the degree of personal detail to be shared: The Mentor and the Mentee should agree on the topics that they are comfortable discussing and on the degree of personal details that they are comfortable sharing. The Mentee, for example, may appropriately initiate discussion of personal topics such as problems with family and friends, religion, and death. The Mentee should, however, approach such topics cautiously and ask the Mentor whether the Mentor wishes to pursue such topics. If the Mentor expresses unwillingness, reluctance, or discomfort in discussing a specific topic, the Mentee shall promptly cease pursuing that specific topic.
 
5. **Personal Relationships**

	I shall not pursue a romantic or sexual relationship with my Mentor.
 
6. **Meetings in Person**

	If my Mentor does not wish to meet in person, I shall not insist on a meeting.
	
	> *Notes:* If circumstances permit, in-person meetings between the Mentor and the Mentee can be beneficial for developing personal rapport, and the Mentee can often benefit from visiting the Mentor’s workplace. It is appropriate for the Mentee to invite the Mentor to meet in person; but, if the Mentor does not wish to meet in person, then the Mentee shall not insist on a meeting. Additionally, some employers have restrictions on visitors to the workplace.
 
7. **Prohibited Advice**

	I shall not seek medical, mental-health, or legal advice from my Mentor.

	> *Notes:* Medical, mental-health, or legal advice should be provided by a qualified professional. Even if the Mentor is coincidentally a qualified professional (for example, if the Mentor is a physician, psychologist, or attorney), the Mentee shall not request the Mentor for medical, mental-health, or legal advice: Within the JDSG Mentoring Program Program, the Mentor provides guidance for the academic and professional development of the Mentee. The Mentee should seek the assistance of another qualified professional.
 
8. **Financial Assistance**

	I shall not ask my Mentor for money.

	> *Notes:* In general, the Mentor should avoid giving money to the Mentee. In specific circumstances, the Mentor may volunteer to give money to the Mentee (for example, to assist the Mentee in paying fees for attending a conference). Under no circumstances, however, is it appropriate for the Mentee to ask the Mentor for money.
 
9. **Career Assistance**

	I shall not expect my Mentor to find me a job.

	> *Notes:* For a Mentee who is seeking employment (or looking to switch jobs), much of the discussions with the Mentor will of course focus on career opportunities. It is appropriate, for example, for the Mentee to ask the Mentor to assist in writing a resume and to review a resume. It is also appropriate for the Mentee to ask the Mentor for advice on conducting interviews and for advice on job-search strategies. It is not appropriate, however, for the Mentee to expect the Mentor to act as a job placement service and to circulate the Mentee’s resume as a matter of course. Under specific circumstances, the Mentor may volunteer to circulate the Mentee’s resume among the Mentor’s colleagues and to inquire whether there is a suitable job opening; however, such assistance is strictly at the discretion of the Mentor, and the Mentee shall not expect, or demand, that the Mentor perform such actions as a requirement of the mentorship.
 
10. **Duty to Report Code Violations**

	If I observe any Participant behaving in a manner that violates the JDSG Mentoring Program Code of Conduct for Mentors or the JDSG Mentoring Program Code of Conduct for Mentees, I shall promptly report my observations to JDSG Mentoring Program staff at juniordevsg-mentoring@codersg.com.
